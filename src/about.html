    Hi, I'm Addie. I am an artist who draws cartoons out of my real friends and family.
    I put peoples dreams into paper if they ask me to.
    I've been drawing cartoons since I was in the first grade,
    and seven years ago in 2016 when I went through a drawing anime phase.
    My art is $25, $50, to $75.
